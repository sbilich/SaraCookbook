    "In a large pot, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and translucent, about 20 minutes.",
    "Stir in the flour and cook for about 3 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly and turns a pale golden color. Be careful not to let it brown.",
    "Add the tomatoes with their juices, chicken broth, sugar, salt, celery salt, and pepper. Increase the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Once it starts bubbling, lower the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pot.",
    "Stir in the half-and-half and honey. Remove from heat, then pur√©e the soup with a hand blender, or let it cool until it's no longer steaming and blend in batches using a stand blender. Return to medium heat to warm through and serve hot."
